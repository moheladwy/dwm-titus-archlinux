# Release Checklist

Release artifacts are generated from the release build configuration. Do not
use `make native` for published binaries.

1. Update `VERSION` in `config.mk` and move the applicable `CHANGELOG.md`
   entries from Unreleased into that version.
2. Commit and push the release source. The helper refuses dirty worktrees,
   version mismatches, and commits that are unavailable on GitHub.
3. Run `scripts/run-tests`.
4. Run `scripts/run-tests make check-xvfb-runtime check-monitor-tags` in isolated X11.
5. Run `scripts/run-tests make check-arch-platform check-arch-packages`, and run
   `scripts/run-tests-podman` in the pinned Arch container.
6. Run `scripts/run-tests make check-quickshell-qml check-quickshell-health-xvfb
   check-quickshell-settings-xvfb` when QML changed.
7. Run `npm --prefix docs ci` and `npm --prefix docs run build` when published
   documentation changed.
8. Run `scripts/run-tests make release-check` and confirm the artifact is named
   `release/dwm-titus-VERSION.tar.gz`.
9. Record the rolling-release validation record (test date, archive snapshot,
   and pacman, Quickshell, Qt, and kernel versions), X11 environments, known
   limitations, and SHA-256 checksum in the release notes.
10. Tag the release only after all applicable `SPEC.md` acceptance criteria
    and required GitHub checks pass.

`scripts/run-tests` creates an isolated directory below
`${DWM_TEST_TMP_ROOT:-$HOME/tmp}` and removes it on success, failure, or
interruption. Store
disposable VM disks and installer logs under a separately named directory in
that same root, then delete that exact directory after qualification. Do not
use `/tmp` for VM qualification.

To create the GitHub release and bump to the next minor development version:

```sh
scripts/dwm-titus-release --version v0.6.1 --notes RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

After publishing `v0.6.1`, the script updates `config.mk` to `VERSION = 0.7.0`
unless `--no-bump` is provided.

The helper validates and hashes the source archive before it creates a remote
tag or release. Releases contain only the source tarball; the project publishes
no installer images, package repository, or signing keys. Users install Arch
Linux from the official ISO or `archinstall`, then run `./install.sh`.
`--version` confirms the version already committed in `config.mk`; it does not
rewrite release source.

`make release-check` builds the archive twice and verifies identical bytes,
the generated desktop-session path, required archive entries, and the absence
of `config.h` and object files.
